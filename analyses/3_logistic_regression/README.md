# Train logistic regression models

Here, we train several lasso logistic regression models in a nested cross-validation. They can all be called via acc_run_models.sh and we distinguish between models trained on cases vs (matched) unaffected controls (acc_predict_HCmodels.py), cases vs population (acc_predict_popmodels.py). These train models to identfiy prodromal, diagnosed, and prodromal & diagnosed Parkinson's disease cases from the respective control group. We train on five different single modality models, as well as their combination with accelerometer modality, and a combined model which is the union of all the modalities. The stacked model, where the output of the modality specific models is combined in a final logistic regression model is trained via acc_predict_stacked.py
